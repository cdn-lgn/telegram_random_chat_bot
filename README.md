# Telegram Anonymous Chat Bot

A simple and fun Telegram bot that allows users to connect randomly with others and chat anonymously. Enjoy making new connections without sharing any personal information.

## 📝 Features
- 🤖 **Start a conversation** with `/start`.
- 🔄 **Match with a random user** using `/match`.
- ⏭ **Skip to the next chat** with `/next`.
- ❌ **End the conversation** anytime with `/end`.
- 📸 **Send photos, stickers, and audio messages** seamlessly.

## 🚀 How It Works
1. **Start the Bot**: Send `/start` to get started.
2. **Find a Match**: Use `/match` to be paired with a random person. If no one is available, you'll be added to the waiting list.
3. **Enjoy Chatting**: Chat anonymously without revealing your identity.
4. **Next or End**: Use `/next` to skip to a new partner, or `/end` to exit the conversation.
